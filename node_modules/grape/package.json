The results file is a slightly rewritten copy-pasta of @substack's version.\r\n\r\nCurrently Grape has the same API as Tape in terms of assersions, but isn't quite the same ata deeper level, as a test instance does not inherrit from EventEmitter at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Stability\r\n\r\nGrape was whipped up in a few hours, but it seems to work when used normally. Pull requests welcome.\r\n",
